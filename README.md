# Flood-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
This project focuses on predicting flood probabilities using a Random Forest Regressor. The model was trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of floods based on various environmental and geographical factors. The dataset includes variables such as Monsoon Intensity, River Management, Urbanization, and more.
